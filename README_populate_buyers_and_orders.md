3. **Database**: Check the database tables

Example Django shell commands:
```python
from buyer.models import Buyer, Order, GiftBoxOrder, Address
from seller.models import Seller, Product, Promotion

# Check buyers
Buyer.objects.count()
Buyer.objects.all().values_list('name', 'email')

# Check orders
Order.objects.count()
Order.objects.filter(order_type='cod').count()

# Check gift box orders
GiftBoxOrder.objects.count()
GiftBoxOrder.objects.filter(order_type='cod').count()

# Check orders with promotions
Order.objects.filter(promotion__isnull=False).count()

# Check buyer orders
for buyer in Buyer.objects.all()[:5]:
    regular_orders = buyer.order_set.count()
    giftbox_orders = buyer.giftbox_orders.count()
    print(f"{buyer.name}: {regular_orders} regular + {giftbox_orders} gift box = {regular_orders + giftbox_orders} total")

# Check order items
from buyer.models import OrderItem
OrderItem.objects.count()

# Check addresses
Address.objects.count()
```
