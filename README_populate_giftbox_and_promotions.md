    print(f"{campaign.name}: {campaign.participants.count()} sellers")

# Check promotions
Promotion.objects.count()
for promotion in Promotion.objects.all():
    print(f"{promotion.name}: {promotion.products.count()} products, {promotion.discount_value}% off")

# Check seller participation distribution
for seller in Seller.objects.all():
    campaigns = seller.giftbox_participations.count()
    promotions = seller.promotions.count()
    print(f"{seller.shop_name}: {campaigns} campaigns, {promotions} promotions")
```
